 * Description: Implements the Threewayquicksort sorting algorithm.
 *
 * Note: Simple Quicksort exhibits poor performance for inputs that contain many
 * 		 repeated elements. This implementation is more eficient for cases with
 * 		 many repeated elements.
 *
 * About:
 *
 *   In simple QuickSort algorithm, we select an element as pivot, partition the
 *   array around a pivot and recur for subarrays on the left and right of
 *   the pivot.
 *   Consider an array which has many redundant elements. For example,
 *   {1, 4, 2, 4, 2, 4, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 1, 4, 4, 4}. If 4 is picked as
 *   a pivot in Simple Quick Sort, we fix only one 4 and recursively process
 *   remaining occurrences.
 *   The idea of 3 way Quick Sort is to process all occurrences of the pivot and
 *   is based on Dutch National Flag algorithm.
 *
 *   In 3 Way QuickSort, an array arr[l..r] is divided in 3 parts:
 *     a) arr[l..i] elements less than pivot.
 *     b) arr[i+1..j-1] elements equal to pivot.
 *     c) arr[j..r] elements greater than pivot.
 *
 *
 * Conclusions:
 * 	   The 3-way partition variation of quick sort has slightly higher overhead
 * 	   compared to the standard 2-way partition version. Both have the same best,
 * 	   typical, and worst case time bounds, but this version is highly adaptive
 * 	   in the very common case of sorting with few unique keys.
 *
 * PROPERTIES:
 *
 *    Not stable
 *    O(lg(n)) extra space
 *    O(n^2) time, but typically O(nÂ·lg(n)) time
 *    Adaptive: O(n) time when O(1) unique keys
