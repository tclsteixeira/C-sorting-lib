**libcsorting** is a self-contained sorting library for arrays and linked lists implemented in C.

This library includes several array sorting algorithms such as insertionsort, selectionsort, bubblesort, shellsort, quicksort, mergesort, heapsort, timsort, countingsort, bucketsort, radixsort, treesort, introsort among others. There are also some sorting algorithms for linked lists like insertionsort, bubblesort, quicksort and mergesort.
Most of them are implemented in a generic way so they can sort any type of data, others are specific to numeric types like radixsort or counting sort.
Explanations about the algorithms and performance analisys is provided as comments at the begining of each code file.

To execute a demo, please run "main.c" and see the code.
